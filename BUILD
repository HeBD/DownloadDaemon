To build DownloadDaemon, you need to have libcurl (libcurl-dev), boost_filesystem, boost_regex and boost_thread installed.
The easyest way to build DownloadDaemon is simply running make.
If you only want to build the daemon and it's plugins and not build any client, run make daemon. if you only want to build the client, run make ddclient.
If you only want to build the plugins, run make plugins. If you only want to build the daemon without any plugins, run make daemon_only.
To install DownloadDaemon, run make install. This will install the program to /opt/downloaddaemon and put a starter in /usr/local/bin.
You can change this behaviour by editing the variable in the Makefile. This option will simply install everything that has been built before.
You do not have to install the program if you don't want to. You can simply run the downloader after building by executing ./downloaddaemon
