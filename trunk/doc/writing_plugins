This is a shourt introduction about how to write new Plugins for the downloader to support more hosters.
Generally a plugin can only be written in C++ (C might be supported soon).
Plugins are basically shared libraries which are loaded on runtime to execute some funtions.
Good examples can be found for the rapidshare.com and uploaded.to plugins in src/daemon/plugins.
For an example of captcha-decoding, check the netload.in plugin.
A plugin always has to be named after its hoster, plus the ".so" file extension and "lib" file prefix for shared libraries.
so for rapidshare.com, you will get a plugin-library called "librapidshare.com.so".
Anyhow, all work should be done by the plugin except for the final step of downloading the file. 
The main program will do that.
Now let's start!
every plugin has to define two functions for the downloader, with the following prototypes:

plugin_status plugin_exec(plugin_input &inp, plugin_output &outp)
extern "C" void plugin_getinfo(plugin_input &inp, plugin_output &outp)

The extern "C" is required in order to make execution possible. The plugin will fail if this is missing.
in order to get the needed types from above, you need to include plugin_helpers.h. View that file to see what variables the structs contain.

the first function, plugin_exec is the main plugin function. The parameters are as follows:

plugin_input &inp:
	This parameter will feed you the parameters specified in the plugin_input struct. If your plugin/hoster supports premium access,
	username/password will be specified in here.

plugin_output &outp:
	This structure contains information the downloader needs from you.
	std::string download_url 	= the final URL to download from. If you are done with your plugin, this needs to be specified.
	std::string download_filename	= Some hosters (e.g. uploaded.to) do not specify their filename in the URL. If it's a simple URL (like asdf.com/hello.rar, 
					= you don't need to fill this out. If it's a special URL (uploaded.to/asdf, filename should be Hello.rar), this needs to
					= be specified.
	bool allows_resumption		= Specifies if the download shoul be resumed if the download on this file has been partly finished before.
					= this is not supported by all hosters.
	bool allows_multiple		= This specifies if the hoster currently supports multiple downloads at the same time. (If this depends on if you are
					= a premium user or not, make your answer dependent.

When your plugin finished, you may return one of the following values: 
PLUGIN_SUCCESS, PLUGIN_ERROR, PLUGIN_LIMIT_REACHED, PLUGIN_FILE_NOT_FOUND, PLUGIN_CONNECTION_ERROR, PLUGIN_SERVER_OVERLOADED,
PLUGIN_MISSING, PLUGIN_INVALID_HOST, PLUGIN_CONNECTION_LOST, PLUGIN_WRITE_FILE_ERROR, PLUGIN_AUTH_FAIL

You should consider making your plugin premium account compatible. You will receive the credentials from the plugin_input structure, if present.
DownloadDaemon supports basic http authentication for premium accounts. Your plugin only needs to set the authentication options into the
curl handle returned by get_handle(). If the authentication method is just a simple http auth, DownloadDaemon will check if they are wrong automatically.
If the server does not return a 401 answer if the credentials are wrong, you need to do manual validity checks and return PLUGIN_AUTH_FAIL if the
credentials are wrong.

plugin_helpers.h implements a few more functions you might need. Check out that header file, the beginning are just a bunch of declarations with
inline-documentation. Check it out over there.


In some rare cases, it might be possible that the plugin has to check if the downloaded file is valid (e.g. if parsing is always the same and only
the resulting downloaded file will either be the desired file or some error-page in html. In such cases you can recheck if the downloaded file is valid.
To do so, you have to 
#define PLUGIN_WANTS_POST_PROCESSING
BEFORE including plugin_helpers.h!
then you can define a function with this prototype:
	void post_process_download(plugin_input &inp)
For an example, check the netload.in plugin, which does exactly that.


Decoding captchas:
DownloadDaemon uses gocr to decode captchas. This, however, is optional. If gocr is not installed, captcha-decoding will not work.
To make your plugin decode captchas, you can use the full set of gocr functionality.
First, you have to download the captcha file from the hoster and save it in a std::string variable (NOT to a file).
then create an opject of type "captcha". the constructor only takes one argument: the captcha-string.
the next step is decoding the captcha. call the "process_image" method of your captcha object with the following prototype:
std::string process_image(std::string gocr_options, std::string img_type, bool use_db = false, bool keep_whitespaces = false)
This method returns the result from gocr.
The first parameter sets the options for gocr (could be someting like "-m 2 -a 20 -C 0-9").
The second option is the file-type of the image. Just pass the file-ending it usually has ("png", "jpg", "gif", etc).
For complicated captchas, usually gocr-databases are used. If you don't know how to create such a database, ask google.
You just put that database files in share/downloaddaemon/plugins/captchadb/<host>.
The last parameter is for stripping out all whitespaces of the resulting string, so if gocr detects "123 4", the function will return "1234" instead.

You don't have to take care of the captcha-max-retry configuration. If you try to decode more captchas as specified in the configuration, the captcha-class will
throw an exception to exit the plugin. This means you may not put the captcha decoding process in a try{} catch(...)! This is not allowed! (or if you do so, you have to exit
the plugin manually).

If you need more functionality to support your specific hoster, please write me, Adrian Batzill (see AUTHORS file) an email. I will then implement it.
