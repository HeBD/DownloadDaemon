Writing a reconnector-script is pretty simple. It can be written in any programming or scripting language you wish,
as long as the resulting file can be executed.
The filename of the reconnector should be <vendor>_<model> and nothing else.
When writing a reconnector, you will get up to three variables as command line arguments.
the first one will be the router's ip address or hostname.
the second one will be a username to log into the router.
the third one will be a password to log into the router.
Not all arguments have to exist for all models or all configurations, so you always HAVE to check
for the number of arguments!
Now just make sure that reconnecting works.
If, however, the reconnect fails because of anything, reutrn something else than 0.
If everything is okay, return 0.
When done, mail me the reconnect script ;) and place it in /opt/downloaddaemon/reconnect.
From then on, it is usable, no restart required.
