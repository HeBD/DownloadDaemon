Writing a reconnector-script is pretty simple. It can be written in c++ (support for C and other languages that are compilable to shared libraries will be
added some day, if there is interest in that, please contact me, Adrian Batzill).
To write a plugin, you simply need to create a .cpp file which includes the following function:

extern "C" void reconnect(std::string host, std::string user, std::string password)

extern "C" is neccessary for symbol loading.. just use it. the parameters will be the router-credentials for you to use.
The filename of the reconnector should be lib<vendor>_<model>.so and nothing else. (spaces within names should be replaced by -
Now just make sure that reconnecting works.
When done, mail me the source ;) and place the .so file in /opt/downloaddaemon/reconnect.
From then on, it is usable, no restart required.
