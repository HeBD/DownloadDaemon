This guide is seperated in 3 parts:
1: Things that you always have to do
2: Things you have to do if you got this guide in a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 source package
3: Things you have to do if you are building from SVN

1:	To build DownloadDaemon, you need to have libcurl (libcurl-dev) and boost_thread (at least version 1.36) installed.
	To build ddconsole, you need to have boost_thread installed (older versions will also do the job)
	To build ddclient-wx, you need to have boost_thread (older versions are enough) and wxWidgets development packages installed

2:	Building a package from a source package is pretty simple. Extract the archive (if you read this, this should be done by now)
	and cd to the new folder. now simply run 
	cmake . && make
	sudo make install
	for an in-source-tree build, which should be enough in most cases.
	If you want to build in another place, simply execute cmake <path to extracted package> instead of cmake .
	The easyest way to build all programs (server and client) is by changing to the build directory and running
	"cmake ..", then "make" and "make install"(as root). This will install the daemon with all plugins and 
	all available clients (except for the web-based php client, you need to do that manually).

3:	Building one of the programs from SVN is a bit harder and depends on what you want to build.
	First, create a directory in your svn root where you want to build:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	If you want to build all programs (downloaddaemon, ddclient, ddclient-wx), you simply run
	cmake .. && make
	If you only want to build a single program, you have to run cmake on their source folders, eg:
	cmake ../src/daemon
	or
	cmake ../src/ddconsole
	or
	cmake ../src/ddclient-wx
	
	in any case, to install the program, run
	sudo make install


ddclient-wx and ddclient will be installed to /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share. downloaddaemon behaves a bit different.
It will be installed completely to /opt/downloaddaemon and place a starter-shell-script in /usr/local/bin. To run it, type
downloaddaemon (or downloaddaemon -d for deamon mode) in a terminal.
If you don't like /opt/downloaddaemon, you can always move it somewhere else, this is no problem (you just need to change the starter-script
/usr/local/bin/downloaddaemon)
