	- Implemented functionality to continue downloads that were started but broke up
	- Changed behaviour if no plugin is found for a download: Download the file directly (makes direct links possible)
	- added CMakeLists file for ddclient-wx
	- Added new reconnect policy "PUSSY" which only reconnects when REALLY necessary
	- fixed race-condition when adding downloads too fast
	- added documentation for writing reconnect scripts
	- small improvement in ddclient
	- improved netpptk and fixed a bug in tkSock::bind. valid/operator bool now means as much as
	  "represents a valid connection" and not "represents a valid socket descriptor"
	- tested the ROUTER target a bit more and included it into cmake list files
	- finisehd (but mostly untested) implementation of the reconnect script engine
	- DownloadDaemon should now handle relative and absolute paths in the configuration file correctly

	- made a class for the download container - cleaner code and more object oriented
	- fixed a lot of minor bugs

	  to make life easier in the future)

	- Made repository public and opened the initial version of DownloadDaemon

	  remote host. The first milestone might be reached soon.
