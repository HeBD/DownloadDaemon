	- made a class for the download container - cleaner code and more object oriented
	- fixed a lot of minor bugs
	- started working on the php-base web interface (login and more 
	  or less downloadlisting seems to work, it's just a few functions
	  to make life easier in the future)

	- Changed from the crappy makefiles to cmake.. more or less successfully

	- Made first developments on a gui client

	- Made repository public and opened the initial version of DownloadDaemon
	  including a hard-to-use commandline client and a plugin for rapidshare.com
	  This version has the general ability to download and to get managed by a 
	  remote host. The first milestone might be reached soon.
