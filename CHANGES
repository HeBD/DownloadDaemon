	- DownloadDaemon now uses proper unix-direcotries (/usr/[local/]bin and /usr/[local/]share/downloaddaemon,
	  as well as /etc/downloaddaemon for configuration files. To keep developing DownloadDaemon, you need
	  to have called "make install" once, to create the download target default folder /var/downloads and copy
	  the config files to /etc/downloaddaemon. The binaries are always used from the svn root (plugins, main program
	  when you run it in the IDE (to do so, you might have to change permissions/owner for /var/downloads and /etc
	  /downloaddaemon))
