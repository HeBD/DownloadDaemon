2: correctly handle absolute and relative paths in the configuration file
4: make it possible to download files through the mgmt interface
5: compile netpptk and cfgfile as shared libraries

7: finish reconnect script implementation (update protocol, add ROUTER target)
8: implement all the # not implemented-s in hostinfo
9: implement premium account support
10: implement some type of container format to import/export huge lists
11: write a few plugins
12: handle container formats of other downloaders
13: speed regulation
14: extend netpptk to get endpoint info and display connecting IPs in logfile
15: Make a multiuser-system out of downloaddaemon with partly individual configuration (download-folder) and administration...
