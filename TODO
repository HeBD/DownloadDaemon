1: find a way to cross-compile it to ARMs (scratchbox) - sadly, boost::thread makes problems - maybe replace it with a small custom thread library based on pthreads?
2: correctly handle absolute and relative paths in the configuration file
4: make it possible to download files through the mgmt interface
5: compile netpptk and cfgfile as shared libraries
6: get the wx-client finally working... (damn listctrl seg faults...)
7: implement reconnect script executuion
8: implement all the # not implemented-s in hostinfo
9: implement premium account support
10: implement some type of container format to import/export huge lists
11: write a few plugins
12: handle container formats of other downloaders
13: speed regulation
14: extend netpptk to get endpoint info and display connecting IPs in logfile
15: make ddclient userfriendly and finish ddclient-wx
