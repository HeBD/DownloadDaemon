- make it possible to download files through the mgmt interface
- write a few plugins
- handle container formats of other downloaders (mainly ccf and rsdf. won't support DLC because it's not open-source friendly)
- speed regulation (for now impossible because of libcurl bugs I can't fix)
- Make a multiuser-system out of downloaddaemon with partly individual configuration (download-folder) and administration...
