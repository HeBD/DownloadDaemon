- (very small one): php client, add downloads, 3rd line: correct spelling of necessary
- find a way to cross-compile it to ARMs (scratchbox) - succeeded in building a statically linked binary, but curl_easy_perform crashes (seg fault)
- put DownloadDaemon and clients in proper unix/windows-specific paths instead of just /opt/...
- make it possible to download files through the mgmt interface
- compile netpptk and cfgfile as shared libraries
- implement all the # not implemented-s in hostinfo
- implement premium account support
- implement some type of container format to import/export huge lists
- write a few plugins
- handle container formats of other downloaders
- speed regulation
- extend netpptk to get endpoint info and display connecting IPs in logfile
- Make a multiuser-system out of downloaddaemon with partly individual configuration (download-folder) and administration...
- Rewrite the plugin systems to use dynamicly loaded shared libraries instead of executables.
